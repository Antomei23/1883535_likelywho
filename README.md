# LikelyWho

A distributed web app that lets a group of users vote on fun “Who is most likely to…?” prompts, collect votes, and show a leaderboard. Questions can be user-entered, or randomly generated by topic.

## Objectives

Build a distributed system that allows a user to:
- create a group, generate an access code and a question for the group members,
- join a voting session via a shared invite code.
Each participant vote for another group member, and aggregate votes will be displayed in a leaderboard (most voted wins).
An example of prompt is: "Who is most likely to spend hours customizing their game character?".


## Full Start (clean setup)

Run all commands from the project root.
1) (Optional) Clean everything
```sh
docker compose down -v
```

2) Build and start all containers
```sh
docker compose up -d --build
```

3) Apply Prisma migrations & seed

Run only where you have Prisma configured.

### AUTH
```sh
docker compose exec auth-service npx prisma migrate deploy
docker compose exec auth-service npx prisma db seed
```

### USERS

docker compose exec user-service npx prisma db seed
```

### VOTING

### QUESTION (only if it uses Prisma)
