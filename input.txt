## Project Description
The primary objective of this project is to create a distributed application that enables a group of friends to engage in interactive voting on various topics based on themselves. The system will facilitate group interactions by providing entertaining prompts, collecting votes, and presenting the results.
For example, the application makes the following question to the group: "*Who is the most likely to become a millionaire?*" and each person can vote for one member of the group. At the end the results are shown and the most voted person earns some points.
### System Description:
The system is a distributed application designed to:
1. Exploit distributed architecture, allowing a group of users to form a voting session via a shared invite code or group link.
2. Provide scalability: The system scales horizontally to accommodate an increasing number of players.
3. Guarantee persistence by storing player scores, poll state, and other relevant data persistently in a distributed database.
4. Support secure user authentication mechanisms.
Present a pre-defined or user-suggested question to the group.
5. Dynamically generate relevant questions based on a chosen topic.
6. Enable each participant to vote for another group member.
7. Aggregate and display the voting results, highlighting the user with the most votes.
Optionally archive past voting sessions.
### Potential Users
- Friends and family groups: Looking for a fun way to connect and stay in touch.
- Teams or coworkers: Interested in icebreaker activities or informal team-building exercises.
- Event organizers: Using the app to add interactive and engaging elements to events.
### Use Cases
- User Registration: New players can register and create accounts.
- Game Lobby: members can join or create question rooms with specific or random topics.
- Scoring and Leaderboards: The system tracks members scores and updates leaderboards accordingly.
- Question expiration handling: The system properly handles the end of a session, initiating score calculation and updates.
- Scaling the system: The system dynamically scales to maintain performance as the number of members increases.

# User Stories
1. As a user, I want to create an account using my email or social login, so that I can participate in voting sessions securely.  
2. As a user, I want to log in securely, so that my scores and history are saved.  
3. As a user, I want to reset my password in case I forget it, so that I can regain access to my account.  
4. As a user, I want to edit my profile (e.g., name, profile picture), so that my friends can recognize me easily in the app.  
5. As a user, I want to log out of my account securely, so that I can protect my data on shared devices.  
6. As a user, I want to create a voting session and invite my friends via a link or code, so that we can vote together and I can become the session leader.  
7. As a user, I want to join an existing voting session using an invitation code, so that I can participate in my friendâ€™s game.  
8. As a session leader, I want to choose a pre-defined category (e.g., "fun," "career," "future predictions") so that the voting questions are relevant to my group.  
9. As a user, I want to ask the system to generate a category randomly, so that the voting questions are relevant to my group.  
10. As a session leader, I want to disable the self-voting choice, so that no participant can vote for themselves.  
11. As a user, I want the app to randomly generate a fun question based on our chosen topic, so that we always have different questions.  
12. As a user, I want to vote for one of my friends in response to the question, so that my choice is counted.  
13. As a user, I want to see a leaderboard of my friends, so that I can compare scores.  
14. As a user, I want to have all groups in the home page, so that I can access them easily.
